# What is this?

RPG Maker is an awesome game-making tool by EnterBrain. The core game comes with some resources, and you can extend it in a multitude of ways. Unfortunately, there are two big problems with finding scripts right now:

1. **Link Rot:** Sites move or go down. DropBox quotas run dry. You can't always get access to scripts you want.
2. **Versions and Attribution:** most scripts are scattered in the RPG Maker forums (or elsewhere on the net)

There is a need for a single, central repository of scripts (just like Ruby's Gems, Java's Maven, or C#'s NuGet). Users can always get access to scripts, and authors can update their scripts freely, giving us a *single, always up-to-date place to get access to scripts.*

That's what this repository is. Feel free to browse and download whatever you wish. (Future versions may include a local search client.)

**How you can help:**

- **Add scripts:** Send us pull requests to add or update your scripts.
- **Link scripts:** Link our [home page](http://ashes999.github.io/rpg-maker-resources) wherever you're sharing your scripts, so people can find a copy if your copy becomes unavailable.
