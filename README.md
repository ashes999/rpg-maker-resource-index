# What is this?

RPG Maker is an awesome game-making tool by EnterBrain. The core game comes with some resources, and you can extend it in a multitude of ways. Unfortunately, most scripts are scattered in the RPG Maker forums (or elsewhere on the net); this is an attempt to collect the latest and greatest version of everything into *a single repository*, like Maven/RubyGems/NuGet, so you can always get access to the latest stuff from one place.

For now, the repo is static; future versions will include a web front-end.
