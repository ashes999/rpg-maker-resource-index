# RPG Maker MV Resources

[View the website](http://ashes999.github.io/rpg-maker-mv-resources) where you can search for resources (eg. tilesets, portraits) and scripts (eg. time of day) for RPG Maker MV games.

# How to Find Stuff

- Click the "scripts" link (to search scripts) or the "resources" link (to search resources)
- Type in whatever you want in the search filters to find what you need.
- Check the commercial terms of use, that they apply to your project
- Click the homepage link to view the script/resource homepage, or the download link to download the version from our repository (may not be the latest version)

# How to Add Stuff

Want to add or update your own script or resource to the repository? Then you need to:

- Fork this repository by pressing the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of GitHub
- Click on `scriptsRepository.js` (to add/edit scripts) or `resourcesRepository.js` (to add/edit resources)
- Click the edit (pencil) icon.
- Make your changes to the array returned by `getData`. If you want to add a new item, just copy/paste the last item, and add a comma.
- Download a copy of the script/resource, and add it to the appropriate folder (`scripts` or `resources`) and subfolder. **This keeps it available even if the author's website goes down.**
- Test your changes, and commit. (You need to clone the repository locally to do this, or you can just commit your change and use GitHub Pages to review it.)
- Create a pull request to merge your changes back to the master repository.
