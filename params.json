{"name":"Rpg-maker-resources","tagline":"A central repository for useful resources related to RPG Maker (VX Ace).","body":"# What is this?\r\n\r\nRPG Maker is an awesome game-making tool by EnterBrain. The core game comes with some resources, and you can extend it in a multitude of ways. Unfortunately, there are two big problems with finding scripts right now:\r\n\r\n1. **Link Rot:** Sites move or go down. DropBox quotas run dry. You can't always get access to scripts you want.\r\n2. **Versions and Attribution:** most scripts are scattered in the RPG Maker forums (or elsewhere on the net)\r\n\r\nThere is a need for a single, central repository of scripts (just like Ruby's Gems, Java's Maven, or C#'s NuGet). Users can always get access to scripts, and authors can update their scripts freely, giving us a *single, always up-to-date place to get access to scripts.*\r\n\r\nThat's what this repository is. Feel free to browse and download whatever you wish. (Future versions may include a local search client.)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
